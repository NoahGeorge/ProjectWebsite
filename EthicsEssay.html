    					<h2>Engineering Ethics</h2>
    					<span class="position">Noah George</span>
    					<p class="mt-4">The purpose of a code of ethics is to have a base of ethics rules that can be applied to a variety of situation. This list shouldn’t explicitly cover every ethical dilemma, but it should provide a basic set of rules. There are too many possible situations, and no code could cover them all. A code of ethics should be a simple list that can be applied to all situations.</p>
<p class="mt-4">When I am faced with an ethical decision, I think about who this decision affects and what their expectations are. I believe it is important to realize that my action will affect real people with real lives. Its easy to disregard how the outcome of a decision will affect others, so I think this is important to keep in mind.</p>
<p class="mt-4">Also, it in important to keep in mind what others expectations of my decisions are. Using privacy as an example: It would be unethical to release data that a customer thought would be kept private. If the customer thought their data was safe when someone had plans to release it, the customer should have been better informed when they first gave up their data. The customers understanding and expectations are important to keep in mind.</p>
<p class="mt-4">In my professional class at ISU, we recently had discussions about situations with ethical dilemmas. We talked about the Ford Pinto ruling, data handling, and Volkswagens emissions fraud.</p>
<p class="mt-4">A friend in this class and I recently had a discussion about Amazons’ obligation to provide the police with Amazon Echo recording data. His view was that amazon should not be allowed to disclose this information under any circumstances. To him, private data should be kept as the name says: private.</p>
<p class="mt-4">I had a different take. In my view, the police collecting this data is no different from collecting evidence with a warrant from a suspect’s house. It doesn’t matter that the physical location of the data is somewhere else.</p>
<p class="mt-4">Even though we disagreed, we had similar takes on the situation. He thought it was Amazon’s ethical responsibility to keep the data safe, while I thought it was Amazon’s ethical responsibility to provide evidence when there is a credible reason, like catching a murderer.</p>
<p class="mt-4">Another ethical situation we discussed in class was also about big data. The basic idea is that a data scientist realizes that the data he is asked to use is being mishandled. From the six virtues of ethics, there are three that are particularly relevant. </p>
<p class="mt-4">The first is responsibility. The data engineer has a responsibility to bring this issue to the attention of his superiors. Its possible that they don’t realize the data is being mishandled, and the situation can be resolved then. </p>
<p class="mt-4">The second is charity. The data engineer should realize why this data is considered to be “mishandled”, and why the owners of the data might not want the data public. The data engineer should realize that it is worth his effort to resolve the problem.</p>
<p class="mt-4">Finally, the third is integrity. Integrity is about actually taking the action to protect the data. With integrity, after informing his superiors of the issue, the engineer should refuse to include the data until it is handled correctly. Integrity is what drives the engineer to do what is right.</p>
<p class="mt-4">The other virtues are also important, but they apply more in the general sense and less to any specific situation. Honesty, fidelity, and self-discipline are more vague ideas that should be used in general.</p>
<p class="mt-4">I’m sure that there are other ethical virtues that could apply to this situation, but that is exactly the point for having a simple code. There are tons of words that express ethical ideas that could be put on the list, but that misses the idea. An ethics code should be a succinct list that expresses the idea of acting ethically, not a rule book that holds all the answers.</p>
